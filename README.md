# AI-Powered Research Assistant

This project is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help users efficiently navigate and understand scientific papers. It combines cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless experience for researchers and humans.

## Main Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Prisma**: An open-source database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript.
- **LlamaIndex**: A data framework for LLM-based applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data.
- **Shadcn/UI**: A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, providing accessible and customizable UI elements.
- **Trigger.dev**: A platform for building and managing background jobs and workflows.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors, ideal for semantic search and AI applications.
- **Sequin**: A tool that syncs your production database to a Postgres database, enabling real-time data access and analysis.
